              <p className="text-gray-600">
              As a store specializing in bulk yarn manufacturing, we process and fulfill large orders tailored to your specific requirements. All orders are custom-made to meet the particular needs of our clients, including color, material, and quantity specifications. Because of the custom nature of these bulk orders, we do not accept returns or offer refunds on orders once they have been processed and shipped.

                Due to the specialized nature of our products, all yarn products, including cotton, silk, nylon, polyester, and blends, are considered non-returnable. If you have ordered yarn in bulk, please ensure the specifications of the order (including color, material, quantity, and quality) are carefully reviewed before finalizing your purchase.
